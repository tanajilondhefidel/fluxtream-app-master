-------------

Fluxtream is based on Spring(-MVC) 3.1, Spring Security 3.1 and JPA for the persistence. We use Jersey (JAX-WS) for exposing the REST API

This is a maven project with 3 sub-modules.

* fluxtream-core: mainly domain classes, persistence, services and support classes for the other modules (e.g. connectors)
* fluxtream-connectors: lots of them - but not all are up-to-date.  Contact us at info@fluxtream.org for current info on connector status.
* fluxtream-web: the main web application, based on twitter bootstrap
